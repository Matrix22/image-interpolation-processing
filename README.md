# image-interpolation-processing
A minimalist Matlab implementation of the image basic processign functions like: rotating an image and scaling an image. The project works for both greyscaled images and RBG images. Project tries to solve those problems using 3 different interpolation methods "proximal", "bicubic" and "lanczos"
